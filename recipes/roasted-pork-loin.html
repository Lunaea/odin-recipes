        <p>Don't get confused by their similar names, pork loin and pork tenderloin are actually two different cuts of meat.
            The <strong>pork loin</strong> is wider, shorter, and flatter and comes from the back of the pig.
            Pork loins can be boneless or bone-in.
            While the <strong>pork tenderloin</strong> is long and narrow and comes from the muscle that runs down the pig's backbone.
            Pork tenderloins are always boneless.

        <p>You may also see pork loins called pork loin roast, center-cut pork roast, center-cut pork loin roast, center-cut rib roast, center loin roast, or pork loin rib half.</p>
